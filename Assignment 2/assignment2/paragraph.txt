Measuring only 10 genes makes for an exceptionally small sample size, especially given that changes in expression for just a few genes can still cause fluctuations in the normalized expression of others. It appears that between the treatment and control groups, the ten genes exhibited relatively similar expression levels overall. This design makes the dataset appear more realistic, as typically only a small number of genes are significantly differentially expressed in biological studies. Thus, this curated dataset reflects the behavior of gene expression without making it seem like every gene is substantially different.
